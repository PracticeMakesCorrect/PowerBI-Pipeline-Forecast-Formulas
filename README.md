# PowerBI-Pipeline-Forecast-Formulas
Part of a project when I supported 6 Sales managers with their forecasting needs. The Power BI report tracks sales pipeline creation, monitors deal progression, and assesses performance against targets. It helps sales managers and representatives identify trends, manage forecasts, prioritize deals, and address attrition risks. It shows short-term changes (e.g. in dollars and forecast status) and provides a strategic overview. 

Formula fields and values have been edited to preserve confidentiality.
